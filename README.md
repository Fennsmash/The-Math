This is the long version. 
The Summary/Definition part available here:
Is the intro into into ALL of the below.
There are several "sections" available in a word doc that is not a virus, email michaelleoemerson@outlook.com and happy to share
Here we go:

*If you have not read Fennsmash before, please skip down until I stop you, and then come back up here :)

This section is all new theory, and I believe every word here will be shown to be true IF I am right about the original argument. It is all falling in place far too well and I see the space, not numbers so it’s not even that hard. So, there is no point in reading it. You need to go to where I stop you, and then if you have trouble proving me wrong, here is the fantasy land of the future. I am constantly updating my work. (Fennsmash(v10) was took about a week-ish)(Just had first memory 1/24/21 6am PST.) When an update comes out you want to come here. At this point in time, when I send this, it will be the oldest this document has ever been. Tomorrow, it will be older.  There might be no visible changes, but it is older nonetheless. How does it compare to previous versions? They exist in the same time, yet we know their “time” is different. What makes one “old”? What makes the other “young” if it exists at the same time? We do. Our experience of it, *is* its relationship to the world. *We* are that which provides its *context* in this reality. If Math is Language, and Math’s context is space, what is the context of space? Time. 

? =>>> (natural Math/an idea) =>>> (written Math/an expression of it) =>>> (Math with the context of space/reality) =>>> (Math with the context of space/reality)(#)(Math with the concept of time) = (our reality) =>>> ?

This is the (lingual/Mathematical) representation of 4 comprehendible universes. Anything before or after is another universe. We can write the Mathematical formula for multiple universes. Actually, the above *is* the formula for other universes. Its continuations will just have a lot of (?) in it. If vibrating string is related to it, sure, on the left, it could be string. If we want to believe in something higher than us, guess what. Something *100%*absolutelty*CAN* exist according to my math. Something 100% almost definitely *DOES* exist in a way I cannot comprehend. For it not to, would be to break the natural cycle of life and language that I see in Math. 

1.	*We* *can* *be* *defined* *as* *time* *mathematically* (I think this is wrong later…you’ll see, but I also have jumped through black holes and back with my dog sooo gonna need to get some sleep and come back.
2.	We exist in the highest out of 4 [currently] comprehendible universes
3.	“God” can be defined as that which is in a higher universe [1/24/21 time not known]
4.	Other universes are almost certainly both to the left and to the right, extending into infinity, as a loop
5.	*We* are *mathematically* …forgive me for not finishing the math for you here… [1/24/21 1:28am PST]
6.	This is pure Math/nature. The ends have to meet. Not because of anything I have proven here, but because of what is VERY strongly indicated in my other document. Nature is cyclical. Math is the language of nature. Math is cyclical.
7.	To the left might be string
8.	To the right, what is “higher” than us…what an amazing thing to think about. I do not believe we can possibly know this, and I don’t know if I want/need to find out. I think it would have to choose to engage with us. The only sensible answer, despite the insensibility, is that it *IS* us. Regardless, there is too much beauty and perfection in math for worry, and no reason not to hope.
9.	I love my dog. Thank you for letting your Dad be a little loopy lately. (I’m on a super huge unimaginably punny roll!) That has GOT to be another record and I wasn’t even trying.
10.	I am not sure what this means but I absolutely legitimately do not think I can know if ANY of this is actually true until I know someone else agrees. And they have to *know* they can’t just say they get it. I basically know that I know this, without even knowing it….weird. It probably actually explains something I will figure out in 5 minutes.
11.	By the way I have a Communications degree and it took me I think 10 years to get it. I lived that restaurant life and I STILL BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD SERVE OTHERS FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR WITHOUT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. It’s honestly a beautiful thing to be forced to see the good in everyone despite…not..loving them.
a.	Lessons: 
i.	how to communicate effectively when being treated unfairly
ii.	how to see good when it’s not on the surface
iii.	appreciation
iv.	

The above is how *I* present the *context* of *us* to *you*.
*We* are *literally* the essence of time – and there is still something *literally* *greater* than *us*
Mic dropFennsmash

Also. This introduces an absolutely fully new *category* of *universe*

1.	If we follow this continuation into ‘infinity’, closing the loop, this system then also needs context.
2.	That which gives it context, is the SECOND DIMENSION.
3.	A dimension can be defined as: That which gives context to another dimension.
a.	Find a better one if you can. Crap that doesn’t work. CONTEXT. I am LEAVING this as a reminder to myself.
b.	Wait. Based on the idea that lines extending into space for infinity create a plane, and a plane then being a new thing, I think the fact that that this unit closes, means anything outside is fair game to give it context, right?
i.	If so, then a dimension *could* give context to another dimension.
ii.	I would have to add something below about the fact that dimensions actually can give context to themselves, I’m pretty sure they can. And that’s maybe it’s actual definition….
iii.	That which gives context to itself. (feels right!! ::pats back::)
4.	Either way, our mistake has been thinking there are three dimensions. This is where your mind gets more blown on how wrong we have been.
5.	We only exist in one dimension, whatever gives our dimension its context, is the second dimension. We also still at heart understand this concept, we just didn’t have the right words or the Math for it. 
6.	IT will follow the same pattern. What follows will not be a dimension, it will need a new name. I think? Let’s call it a Jacle.
7.	Jacles will follow the same loop construct – into barmilonglorias and so on.
8.	Ever wonder where black holes go? Me too. Until I realized while proofreading this and naming my entire family tree into dimensions...that whatever the ‘outside’ of our loop construct is, would be quite a sensible place. Mystery solved 1/24/21 12:43am PST. 
9.	Which means…oof this one hurts the brain..
10.	I think numbers lack context too, to be honest. I think they are probably best defined as: The measurement of time. I don’t think there is a smallest unit of time, it’s probably infinitely large and infinitely small.
a.	New "NL” definition: Time: That which is infinitely small and infinitely large.
b.	Another way I blow the lid off things: All numbers are imaginary. It’s the other element of not having context. Haha. I think I am figuring out the equation for space right now. This is 2. Ohhhhh not just..ooohh!! It IS space and time…but there is one more missing…has to be 3..
c.	It is us. The formula for Natural Language is…lemme write it out..hang on idk yet…might be missing something….we are CLOSEE

((((thought)x(space)x(time)))(#)(the rest of all Math)) = Natural Language = Always correct answer

“Human” or “to be” or to “experience” as defined in natural language = (thought x space x time)

Thought = the speed of light
Time = Experience
Space = Memory

((((speed of light)x(experience)x(memory)))(#)(the rest of all Math)) = Natural Language = Always correct answer

WOW we are getting close and we haven’t even started trying yet….just answering other stuff.

I think memory is Planck squared

Experience…idk still proofreading the other one.


We are judging people in
When we should be unjudging them out
Made it up, makes sense, can’t explain yet

By the way….pretty sure sugar is great for us/our brains. NO idea the science there except I believe brains like glucose and -ose is usually sugar




11.	

NEXT huge update (an hour-ish after writing v1)(you will see I ended up not finishing this out yet, sorry!): In this cycle, machines are in our dimension. ---need to update thoughts on machines. Something here. What is not possible, is for them to *think* or *process* themselves into a higher universe and certainly not a higher dimension. The best they will ever do is *process* faster than us. This might be my first *Leo Law* (not sure what else to call it..not a law of universes or dimensions just what something can or can’t do withing the natural order of things). Basically I think I can prove we can always control machines to do our bidding and be our “slaves” and not the other way around but not there yet. Stay tuned.

I would also like to point out that we live live and in color in 1D. (see what I did there?)

Stop here! You can read on how you like, but there are several sections. Jumping around is not only OK, I encourage it. Confusing? Look at a different section and come back to it. I am making the argument that ALL math that has EVER been done is wrong. Let it sink in. Remember, math has always been written by humans; it didn’t fall from the sky. We can be wrong. And we can correct ourselves a few thousand years later. It would be WILD but not impossible. Maybe I will include a relevant example at some point to drive it home (spoiler alert,, it’s an entire history lesson). That’s my first assertion. It HAS happened before and it IS possible for this to be true, and happening right now. The second, is that I have written the first ever formula of true ‘Natural Math’ and if I come even close to making you think it’s a possibility you really, really, should share this. Remember Copernicus?

And so we begin.

There are 2 separate ways we currently define Mathematics:

1)	There’s actually a TON of definitions for Math which was surprising, so I made my very first point the best definition of Math you will ever read. For this bullet point though, basically if you go online you will find a theme of the *measurement* of  *objects* as the current definition for math.
2)	Natural language. This is the idea of math; pure/perfect ‘Math’. I am saying that I have defined natural language/math, and the math we use today does NOT represent natural language. It is a flawed, erroneous, very close version of natural math that is missing one very key piece. A proper definition. Without a proper definition, we conceptually misunderstood math to be centered around objects. Natural math is not the measurement of objects at all. It is the measurement of all configurations of space. This FIRST mistake, created a flawed framework from which all other math is derived. 

So again, I have to repeat, because it’s an incredible thought but the assertion is ALL math EVER is ‘wrong’. In this document I am communicating to you why I believe that, and I will provide overwhelming evidence that I am correct beyond a reasonable doubt. You might not *see* exactly what I mean but somebody gave this to you for a reason. If I do a good job of persuading you and YOU can’t see why I’m wrong about the craziest claim you’ve ever heard then this deserves a share. How much better would a story about everyone getting their report cards fixed be vs coronavirus? 

If you are even slightly moved to considering I proved all of Math wrong, please give me some creativity points and share this. Not everyone is going to listen, and not all those who do are going to get it. We all need to work together to get our report cards fixed! If nothing else, tell someone all of math is wrong, use this to defend yourself, and see if they can win. I can’t ‘prove’ any of this with broken math obviously, so it has to be words. I put them together in every way I know how to get this across to you right now, I literally don’t know any other words to use to prove this.










Here’s the menu!

It is messy looking, sorry, workin on that too.

1.	Definition area
2.	Visual perception/thought perception
3.	Story area (I love telling stories!)
4.	Me being very clear how important context is (don’t skip!)
5.	History lesson, sorry!
6.	How to fix it all! AND a green surprise 
7.	This argument expressed as logic
8.	Mic drop of exhaustion (and contentment)+(and hope)+(and thanks)

*Disclaimer: I believe ALL the math that has EVER been done is wrong. I will defend this in not one but many ways. I am asking for someone to point out where I am wrong - but what I really want is for this info to be shared. I can defend this entire document to the letter. Including that I wrote the first ever ‘true’ natural Math expression. Challenges should be in the form of: Statement of a fact & explanation of how that fact contradicts anything below. It CANNOT be an example of a Math problem that is ‘proven’ to be correct, because my entire document *IS* the argument that what you are showing me is already wrong. You can’t use broken math to tell me I’m wrong about natural language.

Part one: Definition of Math
(menu)

My definition of math is: The measurement of all possible configurations of space.
There’s nothing about shapes. Why? Because those create an erroneous context. Words. Matter. It is the wrong perspective; it puts our perspective inside the equations when we need to be outside. This is a *huge* difference. Like where we are in the universe. Perspective. Matters. It needs to be correct in natural language. It needs to be fixed.

New concepts: 
•	Infinity is the largest possible amount of space
•	The smallest possible amount of space is a point
•	Everything in between is fair game
•	(I do not know what this means for our friend zero. I think Zero is probably safe.)

New concepts that break ‘math’ here: 
•	There is no negative space
•	There is no negative infinity
•	Einstein’s relativity? Wrong. Yep. Wrong. (Physics doesn’t work anyway, why not question Einstein?)
•	Imaginary numbers? WOW they even named them imaginary. Don’t exist.
o	You will find that I was wrong here when you get to theory. You will see I theorized 4 possible universes, connecting in an undefined loop. Imaginary numbers do exist, and apparently, they create a loop of 4. Just like your friendly neighborhood storyteller predicted would eventually occur. So this has been edited to say in addition to everything else that keeps falling into place, I have defined and given imaginary numbers their place in Natural Language without doing a single Math problem. Magic? Nope. Context. They are the 4 known (and what would appear to be *possible*) universes! BIG point for Leo vs “the machine”, big assist points B Falcone:) I would also guess there’s just some very weird things about them as they are distinct from other numbers in their 1:1:1:1 relationship with each other and no other context. (the context is another dimension and I proved/wrote out that math under theory already too.) Anything I theorize from scratch I am confident I can figure out while I work on harder things. Hooray for imagination, we get to keep you!!

Challenge 1: Find a better definition of Math and tell me why it is better. 
Challenge 2: Ignore all the math you know and think about yourself, then the Earth and then the Universe plus all of the space in it. We didn’t have the ability to do that when we started writing Math, we thought Earth was flat. Just like we didn’t have telescopes and we tried to figure out our place in the universe. It wasn’t really our fault but we know more now. We can imagine a lot of things, but have you ever seen or measured anything outside of those places? Tell me why natural language would have imaginary numbers and negative space – that isn’t “because Math says so”. Those are so obviously not things that should be included in “natural language” my friend. Except technically I did prove “i” exists, I just gave it a definition and made it not imaginary anymore and probably explained why they behave so weirdly in Math today. It’s not that my crazy theory doesn’t fit in with Math – it DOES! 99.99% of Math is fine, we can just make it better.

Part 2: Putting it together visually

Don’t even think about a shape for one second!! :) But seriously. Don’t. Here are 2 different ways you can try to ‘think’ about this:
•	Visualize empty space
•	Then think of the space moving into the shape of a sphere. Then a cube. Then a pyramid.
•	Then think of all the 3D shapes you can just as shapes. Cubes, loops, donuts, whatever.
•	Then clear ALL of that out of your head, and just think of how many different shapes you could make space into. If you start seeing a floating box and you’re just rolling through whatever shape you feel like thinking of space being, it ends up being way different/better than thinking of the shapes. 

This will work better for some than others. Don’t overthink if you don’t get, like I said, you can come back. If you were good at those 3D posters you stare at you will probably be good at this with practice, but basically once you get the feel for switching back and forth, thinking of it as the configuration of space ends up turning all of math into a 3D picture. This also doesn’t “explain” much, it’s just something for visual people, there’s plenty of explaining below.
Part three: Story version
(menu)

Math is called natural language because it follows the same fundamental concepts as written language. It’s just the most pure/natural version of what we try to do with words. In English, we start with letters, then make words, sentences, paragraphs, and so-on. They are building blocks that we put together so that 100 people can hear the same thing and know what is meant. It enables us to communicate because we defined it and gave it a shared meaning. When we take an *idea* from the natural world and turn it into a word, we define something ‘pure’ - like an emotion. 

Let’s say love. Once we have the definition, we can start using it in sentences. If anything is wrong with a definition of one word, the entire sentence changes its meaning, and doesn’t intend what you really meant. Isn’t one of the most annoying feelings in the world saying something with the right words, and then you immediately come back with but wait I didn’t mean it like that, and they’re still all mad at you or hurt? In math, we can easily just call it a wrong answer but language is more complicated because of the human element. In language we get over it by the next sentence. In a perfect language of nature, every single piece is important. One single digit is the difference between right and wrong, or really: truth and not truth. There’s literally 0 flexibility (if that is even a thing anymore).

If we don’t agree on the definition we can’t communicate, and Math does the same thing. Anyone remember the definition of a square and rectangle? You can picture it and you know one has longer sides, but without a *clear* definition for what is different between the two, we’d run into math problems. See what I did there?

I’m saying we got literally the very first part wrong, deciding what Natural Language *IS*. We messed up the definition and we based ALL of our written ’natural language’ on the wrong definition. The great news it it’s 99.999999% right. I’m not saying there aren’t wonderful uses for Math. However, it is absolutely clear in Physics, one of the key math disciplines that something is ‘wrong’ but we don’t know what. The big problems are there because they are measuring the biggest and smallest things in the natural universe, and they need natural language to do it right. I mean, we’re out there using imaginary numbers and negative space. I would think someone who comes along and points out something fishy is going on must be on to something, even if it wasn’t me. I also answered literally all of Physics and our existence in a separate document I will share with anyone who believes this one (even a little). THAT’s the real fun story that got me here in the first place. That’s part 4 of this whole poem-story.

Part 4: Words, and the importance – no – *absolute requirement* of context in both natural language and regular language
(menu)

See something fishy yet, too? Let’s drive this part home: Here’s a little more color on what’s under the hood of this thing we call language (whether verbal, written, English, Math; ALL languages work like this). Again, MATH is based on relationships between things just like written language. There’s structure to it and you can’t just move numbers around in an equation without getting a wrong answer. When you have a sentence, and you move where a word is, it can change the meaning of the sentence and the word. If you type the same word next to itself over and over meaning never comes.

Words alone have definitions, but until they are put into context they don’t really have a purpose or meaning. It’s the whole ‘if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound’ problem. People give the sound its context by hearing it, so when we aren’t there…? 

Same with a single word written on a piece of paper. Hate. It could mean I hate you, I don’t hate you, hate is cool, hate sucks. So, unless you are ok with going through life that confused, you need context. You can have a conversation about a single word like love or hate, but the fact that you are there talking about it gives it context. Like being in the forest when a tree falls. The point here, is that Math is perfect language (no disagreement from Math here). And in addition to my definition making more sense with how you see nature, I’m going to show you exactly how and where it lacks context. Then, I’m going to show you what the context is. Then I’m going to write a math equation that works with the words describing exactly what *should* be there. If I can do anything else at all for you *please* let me know (sincerely, I am convinced, and will be so confused if nobody else gets it after spending an entire week writing this out). Also, to point this out, I am not even saying there aren’t a million mathematicians smarter than me right now and before me, I’m saying we made a mistake early on and just didn’t catch it yet. We made the center of the math universe what we saw: *shapes*. And we built a mighty castle out of it. Does anyone else remember learning about a time where people thought we were the center of another universe, but we had the wrong perspective? It was *the* universe aka *nature*. Have you ever looked back in history and thought ha, well, I would have known better? Is this text more uncomfortable than you think it should be? Thinking about this makes my head hurt and it’s uncomfortable for me, but that’s just my perspective, and brain change hurts. Seriously, if you feel weird take a second to chill out this will still be here!

Let me take you on a brief stroll down/through/inside/above history’s lane so we don’t make the same mistake again:
(no link)
We have been mulling over the center of the universe since the dawn of time. Here is how impactful our perception can be; the below is obviously all based on the science of the day and how far it could *see*. 

•	Axis mundi – something people made up before written history
•	?-current? Flat Earth
•	4th century BCE earth is the center of the universe. Geocentric
•	1500-1600 (not bc) the sun is the center. Heliocentric
•	1900-present. We got it. (decided we don’t and can’t know what is at the center of the universe)
•	Get ready. 1/23/21 11:30 PST I realized we actually are the center of the universe. I already proved this in my other document without realizing it. You can’t tell people the universe doesn’t revolve around them anymore. It does. See bottom for email instructions. Spoiler alert: you are so much more incredible than you know, and the universe is awesome.
o	Also, I know why the speed of light is constant. DM me.

So. Check. This. Out. It took TWO THOUSAND years to realize the sun was at the center of nature. TWO THOUSAND YEARS TO COME UP WITH THE WRONG ANSWER. We JUST figured out we are “not sure” about the center of the universe. We DEMONSTRABLY, double black eye, for all of history to see, have bungled up what was at the center of nature and it was because we based our ‘truth’ on OUR PERCEPTION. Or did our perception miss see the truth..?

WE DID THE SAME THING WITH NATURE-AL MATH. I could not make this up people and I am not yelling, I am shocked/amazed I actually get to be the one who figured this out. Do you remember how hard it was for those guys to change the minds of scientists? I don’t want that to happen to my idea. OUR idea. WE are nature, this is OUR language and I want to help us communicate properly.

I then also remind you, in addition to hyperlinks, we live in the era of social media. Are you going to know first or are your friends going to beat you to it? #didnthappenifyoudontpost. Just sayin. I mean honestly, I need your help. This is why I’m writing a story and not throwing math in your face. I’m not trying to convince scientists; history has shown that doesn’t work. I like to learn from history. I hope you do to. Going to scientists won’t work. I’m trying to convince you, the people, so I don’t have to. Isn’t that the smarter thing to do? I don’t have 2000 years and nobody has questioned this before. It’s an uphill battle but I’m giving you a slow and steady right over the plate and you’re up.

Part 5: Pointing out exactly where in math the problem shows up
(menu)

Where do I think this definition problem actually shows up in Math? It should be *so* easy for me to point out one thing if I have all the answers, right?

Yeah buddy! I got you. Think about this, but don’t get too bogged down by it. You’re not going to snap your fingers and just realize all math is wrong with one thing I tell you. Like I said I’m going to keep explaining and explaining for the rest of what is (at the time I save this version) 8 pages. Just let it slowly sink in, like a wave of awareness while you read and not something that’s going to jump out at you. (Although, it kinda did punch me in the face and I freaked out and call my parents. I just got off a 2 hour Zoom sister and all where I told them Einstein was wrong and bless them they listed to me without calling me a nut, so maybe it will hit you too)

Here’s where it is: Length, Width, Height, Base, Side, no matter what you call it, these are all just measurements of lines in space. You can't use a word to give itself meaning, so you can't use the fact that a base is on the bottom or height is up and down. Flip it on its side. THIS is the context I have been talking about, its missing in ALL of geometry. Parts of math are right I’m sure, like I said 99.999999%, but Physics and Geometry we get a cosmic F and it is NOT our fault! Brilliant people much better with actually applying math than I am will be able to use this information pretty much immediately, especially since I can explain not only HOW it’s wrong but HOW to fix it. We just. Wrote. The Wrong. Definition, and we need to erase one or two things and we are good to go. It was always our humanity, our perception, and now we can have a new one where things make a little more sense. The world seems a little upside down sometimes don’t you think?

Hammering away still, history considered: When the only relationship between lines in space are themselves, it is equivalent to using the same word to define itself. We are writing giant Math equations with tiny chunks underneath it that say (linelinelinelinelineline) under the hood. What's the area of a cube? We think (L x W x H) wraps it up because it works in the smaller problems, but it's really saying (linelineline) in the bigger ones. For math problems requiring perfection to work, something needs to be inside (LxWxH(?)) to give it *context*. Did you go to a different school than me? L x W x H was the idea in mine and pretty sure it still is. Multiplying by itself can be done and will yield a number, but it will lack context, and eventually the HUGE Math problems will start to fail. This is why Math today falls under “good language” and not perfect. Hello quantum mechanics, get your context and get your answers!

Squares, circles, loops, cubes, spheres, donuts, are all closed systems (like sentences) and they don't need context. The individual lines do, and Math today simply does not have it. Just remember, I also told you I figured out a LOT more about what this means in my section at the very top. So far I wrote the first natural language expression, defined the place of humans in math, disproved Einstein, disproved space time exists, defined 4 universes, defined and proved infinite dimensions exist, proved we live in one dimension (we just defined that wrong too) and now I am working on what this all means for ~machines~. I am STILL freaking out!! Oh – no – I didn’t mean it like that, I actually think I proved robots can’t take over but not 100% sure stay tuned things are about to get real. You’ll get your flying hoverboard in a year or two (not 100% sure on that either).

Part 6: How to fix it!!
(menu)

We think of Math as shapes. Math isn’t shapes. Math is all the possible configurations of space. Space is the context for all of Math. An equation for *space* needs to be written and placed outside of every single Math problem ever in order to give it context. No matter how big or how small. It might still work sometimes in the small ones, but that’s just the overlap in meaning and/or the system being too small. It can exist inside the equation, or not, but it MUST exist outside of the entire system in order to get to more *perfect* levels of Math than we have today. Everything else will just be like our closest estimation to Pi. This will probably answer Pi. Want some Pi? I do. If we get this out there before March 14 we can have a Pi party about it! (I’ll date the top of each version for fun – oh, just kidding, I can’t…) 

FYI Infinity is not *the answer* it is just the largest possible configuration of space as I said wayy up top. I really hope I am able to show you there is no possible way this could be wrong, I want to answer questions about what’s next! I don’t even know if Copernicus got credit when he was still alive and I think ‘the man’ at the time did some messed up things to him. I hope Biden is cooler than that. So, without further ado, below outlines all of what I have said in the closest thing to math that words can possibly be. Basically math problems with words in them. I think that green one is the first natural word (or whatever?) actually spelled correctly. 

(+ OR – OR / OR * OR ^ etc.) = # = Relationship = Context
LWH = Length, Width, and Height

It must exist outside as in:

((equation for Space)(#)(the rest of all Math)) = Natural Language = Always correct answer

In Math:

Length Width and Height need context. As in:

((something unidentified)(#)(LWH)) = Answer

So we get to:

(((space)(#)(LWH))(#)(Natural Language)) = Answer in which L/W/H are components.


*honestly, feel free to double check those parentheses I hate figuring that out more than proving Einstein wrong. Just learn to forgive me if everything else is right. All of the first Natural Language formulas are up for grabs. I’m not going to be a jerk and even write the first one with a number, and the one for space is a huge one! Maybe it’s Pi. Maybe..log something or other? It’s probably something from trig I never did like trig. I don’t know. I don’t have all the answers just know how to help.
Part 7: The logic version

The below is my best attempt at explaining this in language and logic (the imperfect form of the natural language, Math). This is more challenging, and pieces will be *imperfect*, because it cannot be perfect. This causes a lot of problems! But if you understand the above first, then you will understand the below. If you understand the below first, you will then understand the above. If you understand neither, but try very hard to understand both, you should get the right idea even if you can’t put your finger on it.

I think this proves length, width, and height are missing Mathematical context and break all of Physics in the process. We all deserve some extra credit reparations from our teachers. I'd like someone to prove me wrong here, or get our report cards edited. Literally all you have to do is find one thing I am wrong about below. I have said a lot and now I’m like ok here also is a numbered list of facts to support my claim just find a single one that isn’t right and we can all go home. But this is all I got left. I truly feel like I did my honest best, and will be at my peace with the world not being ready if that’s the case. BUT. I really want a flying skateboard too..


Here goes: 

1.	English is imperfect language (good)
2.	Mathematics (done correctly) is perfect language
3.	In English, terms can overlap meaning and spelling ((love:like),(music hit:punch hit))
4.	In English, we use contextual sentence clues, and even body language/tone when it is spoken (we don’t have that privilege in Math, it needs to be perfect)
5.	In all language, terms must have context to have meaning
6.	In perfect language, no two terms can mean the exact same thing
7.	In Natural Math all ‘terms’ must be defined perfectly. Including itself.
8.	You cannot give something context through relation to itself
9.	Length, Width, Height, Base, Side, Hypotenuse; these can call be defined as lines in space that aren’t connected at the end. (I almost messed this up. Bad. If I didn’t include the word “space” in that sentence it would be the exact same mistake as the entire thing is disproving. I almost left out “in space” like I’m sure the current definition does. If it’s NOT missing from there, that would be some irony. I spent an entire week writing this and I almost screwed up my own definition of the ENTIRE argument of this paper. That’s how easy it is to very very slightly miscommunicate).
10.	Mathematically, length, width, and height (LWH) are the exact same thing relative to each other; or rather, to itself. Shorter/longer/top/bottom is relative. They are all lines in space that don’t have connected ends (loops). There is no difference other than that. Anything they connect to is context, space is context, but if what they are connected to is another line in space, aka the same thing as itself, that does not provide actual ‘context’. (In the case of a plane, this is all lines extending into infinity along one ‘plane’. This incorporation of infinity and ‘all lines’ creates a new shape (a plane) from which lines *can* get context in Natural Math. SO:
11.	LWH exist in current Math with no context; they are the same thing. (points 5,6,8,9, 10)
12.	LWH cannot exist as separate entities in Math, when done correctly. (points 2,6)
13.	LWH can exist harmoniously in good language but will break this language as it approaches perfection (in Math that’s like writing small equations vs ones that are pages long)
14.	Area: LxWxH is an erroneous, non-contextual closed system and will ultimately break any larger equation it is part of, as the equation approaches perfection (the allowance for small/contextual imperfections goes away)
15.	Until Length, Width, Height, Base, Side, (all the same thing) get their context, we will not be able to complete all of Math. It's like trying to write a perfect paper without knowing how to spell 'the'
16.	We are turning in our graduate Math/physics thesis to the world, expecting an A+, but we can’t spell ‘the’ so it’s getting rejected and we keep trying to turn it in without correcting this one small thing
17.	You should share this
18.	I love my dog

Mic drop of exhaustion.

I did all of this just because I had a different story to tell you. I didn’t care about Math until 4 days ago. I wrote a working universal ‘theory’ of everything for Physics. I think it is great, it’s honestly a pretty cool story that touches on science AND spirituality AND it says both are TRUE and both are WONDERFUL! That is the real story I wanted to tell, but it is imperfect, because language is imperfect. I told the Math people but they said I needed Math. I can’t show the Math, to the Mathematicians because when I started to try it didn’t make any sense to me. I plan to rewrite Mathematics from scratch, I see it in my head not on paper. It’s a lot easier that way.

How’s a guy supposed to convince the world he figured everything out and tell his little story? I will from now on, only share my written theory of everything (how the universe was created and the physics at play) and what I am working on with those who ask me to. And sometimes maybe my family. Ever wonder why it feels natural to block things off (like this) in the middle of sentences? It’s our natural affinity for context. We know we are breaking it, but we can accept it in the middle of a sentence if we isolate it and show it’s in a different context. Context is everywhere, in everything, and everything is a *beautiful*, *natural*, *wonderous*, *cycle*. You just need the right perspective.

It took me 36 years to think up these ideas and a week to write them on paper in a way that people might understand. If you are interested, AMAZING! This is *my* purpose, to share my story of us, and if only one person cares that’s ok. If you share this, and help me tell my story = <3 If you do, let me know, that’s my reward. It’s also my birthday soon. Thank you.
